Netflix, Inc. is an American subscription streaming service and production company. Launched on August 29, 1997, it offers a film and television series library through distribution deals as well as its own productions, known as Netflix Originals.
As of December 31, 2021, Netflix had over 221.8 million subscribers worldwide, including 75.2 million in the United States and Canada, 74.0 million in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, 39.9 million in Latin America and 32.7 million in Asia-Pacific.[11] It is available worldwide aside from Mainland China (due to local restrictions), Syria, North Korea, Kosovo, Russia (due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine) and Crimea (due to US sanctions). Netflix has played a prominent role in independent film distribution, and is a member of the Motion Picture Association (MPA).
Netflix can be accessed via internet browser on computers, or via application software installed on smart TVs, set-top boxes connected to televisions, tablet computers, smartphones, digital media players, Blu-ray Disc players, video game consoles and virtual reality headsets on the list of Netflix-compatible devices.[12][13][14][15] It is available in 4K resolution.[16] In the United States, the company provides DVD and Blu-ray rentals delivered individually via the United States Postal Service from regional warehouses.[17]
Netflix was founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in Scotts Valley, California. Netflix initially both sold and rented DVDs by mail, but the sales were eliminated within a year to focus on the DVD rental business.[18][19] In 2007, Netflix introduced streaming media and video on demand. The company expanded to Canada in 2010, followed by Latin America and the Caribbean. Netflix entered the content-production industry in 2013, debuting its first series House of Cards. In January 2016, it expanded to an additional 130 countries and then operated in 190 countries.
The company is ranked 115th on the Fortune 500[20] and 219th on the Forbes Global 2000.[21] It is the second largest entertainment/media company by market capitalization as of February, 2022.[22] In 2021, Netflix was ranked as the eighth-most trusted brand globally by Morning Consult.[23] During the 2010s, Netflix was the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 stock market index, with a total return of 3,693%.[24][25]
Netflix is headquartered in Los Gatos, California, in Santa Clara County,[26][27] with the two CEOs, Hastings and Ted Sarandos, split between Los Gatos and Los Angeles, respectively.[28][29][30] It also operates international offices in Asia, Europe and Latin America including in Canada, France, Brazil, Netherlands, India, Japan, South Korea and the United Kingdom. The company has production hubs in Los Angeles,[31] Albuquerque,[32] London,[33] Madrid, Vancouver and Toronto.[34] Compared to other distributors, Netflix pays more for TV shows up front, but keeps more "upside" (i.e. future revenue opportunities from possible syndication, merchandising, etc.) on big hits.[35][36]

Launch as a mail-based rental business (1997–2006)[edit]
  Marc Randolph, co-founder of Netflix and the first CEO of the company
  Reed Hastings, co-founder and the current chairman and CEO
On August 29, 1997, Marc Randolph and Reed Hastings founded Netflix in Scotts Valley, California. Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, was a co-founder of Pure Atria, which was acquired by Rational Software Corporation in 1997 for $700 million, then the biggest acquisition in Silicon Valley history.[37] Randolph had worked as a marketing director for Pure Atria after Pure Atria acquired a company where Randolph worked. He was previously a co-founder of MicroWarehouse, a computer mail-order company as well as vice president of marketing for Borland International.[38][39] Hastings and Randolph came up with the idea for Netflix while carpooling between their homes in Santa Cruz, California and Pure Atria's headquarters in Sunnyvale.[19] Patty McCord, later head of human resources at Netflix, was also in the carpool group.[40] Randolph admired Amazon.com and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the Internet using a similar model. Hastings and Randolph considered and rejected selling and renting VHS tapes as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship.[38] When they heard about DVDs, first introduced in the United States on March 24, 1997, they tested the concept of selling or renting DVDs by mail by mailing a compact disc to Hastings's house in Santa Cruz.[38] When the disc arrived intact, they decided to enter the $16 billion home-video sales and rental industry.[38][19] Hastings is often quoted saying that he decided to start Netflix after being fined $40 at a Blockbuster store for being late to return a copy of Apollo 13.[19] Hastings invested $2.5 million in cash from the proceeds of the Pure Atria sale into Netflix.[41][19] Netflix.com launched as the first DVD rental and sales site in 1998 with only 30 employees and 925 titles available—almost the entire catalogue of DVDs at the time.[19][42][43] Randolph and Hastings met with Jeff Bezos, where Amazon.com offered to acquire Netflix for between $14 and $16 million. Fearing competition from Amazon, Randolph at first thought the offer was fair but Hastings, who held a major 70% of the company, turned it down on the plane ride home.[44][45]
Initially, Netflix offered a per-rental model for each DVD but introduced a monthly subscription concept in September 1999.[46] The per-rental model was dropped by early 2000, allowing the company to focus on the business model of flat-fee unlimited rentals without due dates, late fees, shipping and handling fees, or per-title rental fees.[47] In September 2000, during the dot-com bubble, while Netflix was suffering losses, Hastings and Randolph offered to sell the company to Blockbuster LLC for $50 million. John Antioco, CEO of Blockbuster, thought the offer was a joke and declined, saying "The dot-com hysteria is completely overblown".[48][49] While Netflix experienced fast growth in early 2001, the continued effects of the dot-com bubble collapse and the September 11 attacks caused the company to hold off plans for its initial public offering (IPO) and to lay off one-third of its 120 employees.[50]

DVD players were a popular gift for holiday sales in late 2001, and demand for DVD subscription services were "growing like crazy", according to chief talent officer Patty McCord.[51] The company went public on May 29, 2002, selling 5.5 million shares of common stock at US$15.00 per share.[52] In 2003, Netflix was issued a patent by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office to cover its subscription rental service and several extensions.[53] Netflix posted its first profit in 2003, earning $6.5 million on revenues of $272 million; by 2004, profit had increased to $49 million on over $500 million in revenues.[54] In 2005, 35,000 different films were available, and Netflix shipped 1 million DVDs out every day.[55]
In 2004, Blockbuster introduced a DVD rental service, which not only allowed users to check out titles through online sites but allowed for them to return them at brick-and-mortar stores.[56] By 2006, Blockbuster's service reached two million users, and while trailing Netflix's subscriber count, was drawing business away from Netflix. Netflix lowered fees in 2007.[54] While it was an urban legend that Netflix ultimately "killed" Blockbuster in the DVD rental market, Blockbuster's debt load and internal disagreements hurt the company.[56]
On April 4, 2006, Netflix filed a patent infringement lawsuit in which it demanded a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that Blockbuster LLC's online DVD rental subscription program violated two patents held by Netflix. The first cause of action alleged Blockbuster's infringement of copying the "dynamic queue" of DVDs available for each customer, Netflix's method of using the ranked preferences in the queue to send DVDs to subscribers, and Netflix's method permitting the queue to be updated and reordered.[57] The second cause of action alleged infringement of the subscription rental service as well as Netflix's methods of communication and delivery.[58] The companies settled their dispute on June 25, 2007; terms were not disclosed.[59][60][61][62]
On October 1, 2006, Netflix announced the Netflix Prize, $1,000,000 to the first developer of a video-recommendation algorithm that could beat its existing algorithm Cinematch, at predicting customer ratings by more than 10%. On September 21, 2009, it awarded the $1,000,000 prize to team "BellKor’s Pragmatic Chaos".[63] Cinematch, launched in 2000, is a recommendation system that recommended movies to its users, many of which they might not ever had heard of before.[64][65]
Through its division Red Envelope Entertainment, Netflix licensed and distributed independent films such as Born into Brothels and Sherrybaby. In late 2006, Red Envelope Entertainment also expanded into producing original content with filmmakers such as John Waters.[66] Netflix closed Red Envelope Entertainment in 2008.[67][68]

Transition to streaming services (2007–2012)[edit]
In January 2007, the company launched a streaming media service, introducing video on demand via the Internet. However, at that time it only had 1,000 films available for streaming, compared to 70,000 available on DVD.[69] The company had for some time considered offering movies online, but it was only in the mid-2000s that data speeds and bandwidth costs had improved sufficiently to allow customers to download movies from the net. The original idea was a "Netflix box" that could download movies overnight, and be ready to watch the next day. By 2005, Netflix had acquired movie rights and designed the box and service. But after witnessing how popular streaming services such as YouTube were despite the lack of high-definition content, the concept of using a hardware device was scrapped and replaced with a streaming concept.[70]
In February 2007, Netflix delivered its billionth DVD, a copy of Babel to a customer in Texas.[71][72] In April 2007, Netflix recruited Anthony Wood, one of the early DVR business pioneers, to build a "Netflix Player" that would allow streaming content to be played directly on a television set rather than a PC or laptop.[73] While the player was initially developed at Netflix, Reed Hastings eventually shut down the project to help encourage other hardware manufacturers to include built-in Netflix support.[74][75]
In January 2008, all rental-disc subscribers became entitled to unlimited streaming at no additional cost. This change came in a response to the introduction of Hulu and to Apple's new video-rental services.[76][77][page needed] In August 2008, the Netflix database was corrupted and the company was not able to ship DVDs to customers for 3 days, leading the company to move all its data to the Amazon Web Services cloud.[78] In November 2008, Netflix began offering subscribers rentals on Blu-ray and discontinued its sale of used DVDs.[79] In 2009, Netflix streams overtook DVD shipments.[80]
On January 6, 2010, Netflix agreed with Warner Bros. to delay new release rentals 28 days prior to retail, in an attempt to help studios sell physical copies, and similar deals involving Universal Pictures and 20th Century Fox were reached on April 9.[81][82][83] In July 2010, Netflix signed a deal to stream movies of Relativity Media.[84] In August 2010, Netflix reached a five-year deal worth nearly $1 billion to stream films from Paramount, Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The deal increased Netflix's annual spending fees, adding roughly $200 million per year. It spent $117 million in the first six months of 2010 on streaming, up from $31 million in 2009.[85] On September 22, 2010, the company first began offering streaming service to the international market, in Canada.[86][87] In November 2010, Netflix began offering a standalone streaming service separate from DVD rentals.[88]
In 2010, Netflix acquired the rights to Breaking Bad, produced by Sony Pictures Television, after the show's third season, at a point where original broadcaster AMC had expressed the possibility of cancelling the show. Sony pushed Netflix to release Breaking Bad in time for the fourth season, which as a result, greatly expanded the show's audience on AMC due to new viewers binging on the Netflix past episodes, and doubling the viewership by the time of the fifth season. Breaking Bad is considered the first such show to have this "Netflix effect".[89]
In January 2011, Netflix introduced a Netflix button for certain remote controls, allowing users to instantly access Netflix on compatible devices.[90] In May 2011, Netflix's streaming business became the largest source of Internet streaming traffic in North America, accounting for 30% of traffic during peak hours.[91][92][93][94] On July 12, 2011, Netflix announced that it would separate its existing subscription plans into two separate plans: one covering the streaming and the other DVD rental services.[95][96] The cost for streaming would be $7.99 per month, while DVD rental would start at the same price.[97] In September 2011, Netflix announced a content deal with DreamWorks Animation.[98] In September 2011, Netflix expanded to 43 countries in Latin America.[99][100][101] On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced its intentions to rebrand and restructure its DVD home media rental service as an independent subsidiary called Qwikster, separating DVD rental and streaming services.[102][103][104][105][106] On October 10, 2011, Netflix announced that it would retain its DVD service under the name Netflix and that its streaming and DVD-rental plans would remain branded together.[107][108]
On January 4, 2012, Netflix started its expansion to Europe, launching in the United Kingdom and Ireland.[109] In February 2012, Netflix signed a licensing deal with The Weinstein Company.[110][111] In March 2012, Netflix acquired the domain name DVD.com.[112] By 2016, Netflix rebranded its DVD-by-mail service under the name DVD.com, A Netflix Company.[113][114] In April 2012, Netflix filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to form a political action committee (PAC) called FLIXPAC.[115] Netflix spokesperson Joris Evers tweeted that the intent was to "engage on issues like net neutrality, bandwidth caps, UBB and VPPA".[116][117] In June 2012, Netflix signed a deal with Open Road Films.[118][119]
On August 23, 2012, Netflix and The Weinstein Company signed a multi-year output deal for RADiUS-TWC films.[120][121] In September 2012, Epix signed a five-year streaming deal with Netflix. For the initial two years of this agreement, first-run and back-catalog content from Epix was exclusive to Netflix. Epix films came to Netflix 90 days after premiering on Epix.[122] These included films from Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lionsgate.[123][124]
On October 18, 2012, Netflix launched in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden.[125][126] On December 4, 2012, Netflix and Disney announced an exclusive multi-year agreement for first-run United States subscription television rights to Walt Disney Studios' animated and live-action films, with classics such as Dumbo, Alice in Wonderland and Pocahontas available immediately and others available on Netflix beginning in 2016.[127] Direct-to-video releases were made available in 2013.[128][129] The agreement with Disney ended in 2019 due to the launch of Disney+. Netflix retained the rights to continue streaming the Marvel series that were produced for the service until March 1, 2022, following Disney's reacquisition of the rights to those series.[130]
On January 14, 2013, Netflix signed an agreement with Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting System and Warner Bros. Television to distribute Cartoon Network, Warner Bros. Animation, and Adult Swim content, as well as TNT's Dallas, beginning in March 2013. The rights to these programs were given to Netflix shortly after deals with Viacom to stream Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. programs expired.[131]

In May 2014, Netflix acquired streaming rights to films produced by Sony Pictures Animation.[162]

Netflix's attempts to negotiate to allow a limited release in France were curtailed by organizers, as well as French cultural exception law—where theatrically screened films are legally forbidden from being made available via video-on-demand services until at least 36 months after their release.[239][240][241]

Corporate culture[edit]
Netflix's longtime Los Gatos headquarters location and current legal address at 100 Winchester Circle (Building A)Netflix's Los Gatos headquarters expansion campus at 90 to 160 Albright Way (Building G, 101 Albright Way).[26][27]
  Netflix Los Angeles offices at 5808 W Sunset Blvd.
Netflix grants all employees extremely broad discretion with respect to business decisions, expenses, and vacation—but in return expects consistently high performance, as enforced by what is known as the "keeper test."[360][361] All supervisors are expected to constantly ask themselves if they would fight to keep an employee. If the answer is no, then it is time to let that employee go.[362] A slide from an internal presentation on Netflix's corporate culture summed up the test as: "Adequate performance gets a generous severance package."[361] Such packages reportedly range from four months' salary in the United States to as much as six months in the Netherlands.[362]
The company offers unlimited vacation time for salaried workers and allows employees to take any amount of their paychecks in stock options.[363]
About the culture that results from applying such a demanding test, Hastings has said that "You gotta earn your job every year at Netflix,"[364] and, "There's no question it's a tough place...There's no question it's not for everyone."[365] Hastings has drawn an analogy to athletics: professional athletes lack long-term job security because an injury could end their career in any particular game, but they learn to put aside their fear of that constant risk and focus on working with great colleagues in the current moment.[366]

Environmental impact[edit]
In March 2021, Netflix announced that it would work to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the end of 2022, while investing in programs to preserve or restore ecosystems. The company stated that it would cut emissions from its operations and electricity use by 45 percent by 2030. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lack of content production, Netflix had a 14 percent drop in emissions in 2020.[367][368]

Content[edit]
Original programming[edit]
Further information on Netflix original programming: Lists of Netflix original television series (both current, and ended), original films, and stand-up comedy specialsFurther information on Netflix international offerings: Lists of Netflix exclusive international distribution programming and Netflix India originals
A "Netflix Original" is content that is produced, co-produced, or distributed by Netflix exclusively on their services. Netflix funds their original shows differently than other TV networks when they sign a project, providing the money upfront and immediately ordering two seasons of most series.[369]
Over the years, Netflix's output has ballooned to a level unmatched by any television networks and streaming services. According to Variety Insight, Netflix produced a total of 240 new original shows and movies in 2018, then climbed to 371 in 2019, a figure "greater than the number of original series that the entire U.S. TV industry released in 2005."[370] Netflix's total budget allocated to production increased annually, reaching $13.6 billion in 2021 and projected to hit $18.9 billion by 2025, a figure that once again overshadowed any of its competitors.[371]

Film and television deals[edit]
Netflix has exclusive pay TV deals with several studios. The deals give Netflix exclusive streaming rights while adhering to the structures of traditional pay TV terms.
Distributors that have licensed content to Netflix include Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment and previously The Walt Disney Studios (including 20th Century Fox). Netflix also holds current and back-catalog rights to television programs distributed by Walt Disney Television, DreamWorks Classics, Kino International, Warner Bros. Television and CBS Television Distribution, along with titles from other companies such as Allspark (formerly Hasbro Studios), Saban Brands, and Funimation. Formerly, the streaming service also held rights to select television programs distributed by NBCUniversal Television Distribution, Sony Pictures Television and 20th Century Fox Television.
Netflix also negotiated to distribute animated films from Universal that HBO declined to acquire, such as The Lorax, ParaNorman, and Minions.[372]
Netflix also holds exclusive streaming rights to the film library of Studio Ghibli (with the exception of Grave of the Fireflies) worldwide except in the U.S., Canada, China and Japan as part of an agreement signed with Ghibli's international sales holder Wild Bunch in 2020.

Three of its web series, Arrested Development, Hemlock Grove and House of Cards, earned a combined 14 nominations (nine for House of Cards, three for Arrested Development and two for Hemlock Grove).[374] The House of Cards episode "Chapter 1" received four nominations for both the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards and 65th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, becoming the first webisode of a television series to receive a major Primetime Emmy Award nomination: David Fincher was nominated in the category of Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series.[374][375] "Chapter 1" joined Arrested Development's "Flight of the Phoenix" and Hemlock Grove's "Children of the Night" as the first webisodes to earn Creative Arts Emmy Award nomination, and with its win for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series, "Chapter 1" became the first webisode to be awarded an Emmy.[376] Fincher's win for Directing for a Drama Series made the episode the first Primetime Emmy-awarded webisode.[377]
On December 12, 2013, the network earned six nominations for Golden Globe Awards, including four for House of Cards.[378] Among those nominations was Wright for Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama for her portrayal of Claire Underwood, which she won at the 71st Golden Globe Awards on January 12. With the accolade, Wright became the first actress to win a Golden Globe for an online-only web television series. It also marked Netflix' first major acting award.[379][380][381] House of Cards and Orange is the New Black also won Peabody Awards in 2013.[382]
On July 10, 2014, Netflix received 31 Emmy nominations. Among other nominations, House of Cards received nominations for Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series and Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series. Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright were nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. Orange is the New Black was nominated in the comedy categories, earning nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series and Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series. Taylor Schilling, Kate Mulgrew, and Uzo Aduba were respectively nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series (the latter was for Aduba's recurring role in season one, as she was promoted to series regular for the show's second season).[383]
Netflix got the largest share of 2016 Emmy award nominations, with 16 major nominations. However, streaming shows only got 24 nominations out of a total of 139, falling significantly behind cable. The 16 Netflix nominees were: House of Cards with Kevin Spacey, A Very Murray Christmas with Bill Murray, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Master of None, and Bloodline.[384]
Stranger Things received 19 nominations at the 2017 Primetime Emmy Awards, while The Crown received 13 nominations.[385]
In December 2017, Netflix was awarded PETA's Company of the Year for promoting animal rights movies and documentaries like Forks Over Knives and What the Health.[386][387]
At the 90th Academy Awards, held on March 4, 2018, Netflix won the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature for the film Icarus. During his remarks backstage, director and writer Bryan Fogel remarked that Netflix had "single-handedly changed the documentary world". Icarus had its premiere at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival and was bought by Netflix for $5 million, one of the biggest deals ever for a non-fiction film.[388] Netflix became the most nominated network at the 2018 Primetime and Creative Arts Emmy Awards with 112 nominations, therefore breaking HBO's 17-years record as most nominated network at the Emmys, which received 108 nominations.[389][390]
On January 22, 2019, Netflix scored 15 nominations for the 91st Academy Awards, including Academy Award for Best Picture for Alfonso Cuarón's Roma, which was nominated for 10 awards.[391] The 15 nominations equal the total nominations Netflix had received in previous years. Its increased presence in the Academy Awards has led filmmakers such as Steven Spielberg to speak out against the nomination of streaming content. Netflix acquired Grauman's Egyptian Theatre to host events and screen its films and series.[392] However, there are no plans to roll out full theatrical releases there.[393]
In 2020, Netflix received 20 TV nominations and 22 film nominations at the 78th Golden Globe Awards. It secured three out of the five nominations for best drama TV series for The Crown, Ozark and Ratched and four of the five nominations for best actress in a TV series: Olivia Colman, Emma Corrin, Laura Linney and Sarah Paulson.[394][395] Netflix received 30 nominations at the 2021 Screen Actors Guild Awards, more than any other company, where it won 7 awards including best motion picture for The Trial of the Chicago 7 and best TV drama for The Crown.[396][397]
It also received 35 nominations at the 93rd Academy Awards, where it won 7 awards.[398][399]
In February 2022, Netflix’s gritty western The Power of the Dog, directed by Jane Campion, received 12 nominations, including Best Picture, for the upcoming 94th annual Academy Awards. The streamer received a total of 72 nominations.[400] Campion became the third female to receive the Best Director award, winning her second Oscar for The Power of the Dog.[401]

Criticism[edit]
Main article: Criticism of Netflix
Netflix has been subject to criticism from various groups and individuals as its popularity and market reach increased in the 2010s.
Customers have complained about price increases in Netflix offerings dating back to the company's decision to separate its DVD rental and streaming services, which was quickly reversed. As Netflix increased its streaming output, it has faced calls to limit accessibility to graphic content and include viewer advisories for issues such as sensationalism and promotion of pseudoscience. Netflix's content has also been criticized by disability rights advocates for lack of captioning quality.[402]
Some media organizations and competitors have criticized Netflix for selectively releasing ratings and viewer numbers of its original programming. The company has made claims boasting about viewership records without providing data to substantiate its successes or using problematic estimation methods. During the COVID-19 pandemic, some government agencies called for Netflix and other streamers to limit services due to increased broadband and energy consumption as large amounts of the world’s population were at home. In March 2020, the company announced it would reduce bit rates across all streams in Europe, thus decreasing Netflix traffic on European networks by around 25 percent. These same steps were later taken in India.[403]
Its distribution model for original films has led to conflicts with the legacy film industry. Some cinema chains have refused to screen films distributed theatrically by Netflix as the company's release method defies standard release windows. Questions have been raised in reference to the eligibility of Netflix's original films for prestigious accolades like the Academy Awards. The U.S. Justice Department warned the Academy that attempts to change its rules to discriminate against Netflix and other streaming platforms could violate antitrust laws, as the parent companies of the traditional major studios have been making investments into streaming services that are in direct competition with Netflix. After the COVID-19 pandemic forced theaters around the country to close for several months in 2020, the next year WarnerMedia, Disney and Universal each released films on their respective streaming services, HBOMax, Disney+ and Peacock, on the same day they were released in theaters.[404]
